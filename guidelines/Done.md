# Done!
### But are you?

What constitutes a story as being "complete"? Well its a subjective definition per person, we need to define a company standard for all stories.

For a story or work item at Mosaiq to be considered done, it must meet all of the following properties
1) All requirements defined in the story have been completed
2) All requirements defined need to have been tested, both with unit testing and e2e testing.
3) No side effects should be generated. This includes both breaking other features and including more than what was defined.
4) Test coverage must be as close to 100% as possible for all added code. 100% is not *always* possible, but most of the time it is.
5) The changes must be reviewed and approved by at least 1 other developer.

By holding ourselves and our teammates to the highest standards, we will be able to perform as industry-level engineers, build strong coding habits that will pay dividends in the future, and produce top quality software for all our endeavours.
