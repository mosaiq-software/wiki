# Mosaiq Wiki
A private documentation collection since real wikis are only available for GH Pro

All product documentation should be written up formally in Google Docs, but technical documentation, references, and guides can be uploaded here as markdown files for future use.

This is a great place to share tips/tricks you learn while working on projects, best practices, or how-to guides on complicated processes. 

Editing and adding files can be done either by cloning the repo to have it offline, or by editing directly in Github via the edit button.


All wiki pages should be written as markdown (.md) files and can be best viewed directly on github through their MD renderer at (https://github.com/mosaiq-software/wiki/blob/main/README.md)
